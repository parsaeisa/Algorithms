# Algorithms
----------------------------------------------------
### In this repository you can see implementation of some algorithms such as : 
- basic algorithms ( like BFS , DFS , SCC , MST end etc ) 
- text search algorithms (suffix tree , BWT and etc )
-  and  advanced algorithms like ( network flow , simplex , satisfiability and etc ) 

----------------------------------------------------
### these algorithms are seperated in three parts :
- algorithms on graphs (A1-A4)
- algorithms on graphs (A5-A7)
- advanced algorithms (A8 - A11)

>  based on three courses with this name in coursera
